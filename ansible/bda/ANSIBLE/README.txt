these are some playbooks that are meant to run together, rooted at 'setup_magnolia.yml', to produce a magnolia instance
out of thin air.

i have tried to make sure they can run standalone, so that they may be individually tested.

they were developed on / for:
    - CentOS 7.2.1511
    - MySQL 5.6.36
    - Magnolia 5.5.4

    i have not tried any of these on EC2 yet

there are MANY possible todos ... for the current scope, given current time available, those will not now be
implemented.  

these are my first forays into ansible.  no best practices here yet.

ymmv, and etc.
